###Percentage VS Fixed height Our website are responsive if we only have HTML with no CSS. 
Giving it a fixed width & height makes it out of the responsiveness.
Give % rather than px or others to make life much easier for responsiveness.
Fix width might make things overflow where we cani use overflow hidden.
But this might cause the losing the content which can be important.
The chlid width is always the width of that % in relation with parent.
 
Its good idea to avoid the height... 
use padding more than height for more background.. 
like padding 5em or % or rem.

The power of relative units: 

em: its compounds with the parent elements and multiplies along the way
like child * parent * parent/body 
it multiples by parent if we have set there.

rem: sticks to the root elements, like 
body {
font size: 16px
}

child 1 {
font size: 2rem;	it equals 32px
}

child 2 {
font size: 3rem;	it equalts 16 * 3 in rems
}			but in ems its 3 * 2 * 16 = 6 * 16 

So, thats the thing to consider.

The power of max-width: 
it is used in big screen where the sizes stick to the size and 
doesnt go long the way... 
and makes our design more pleasent.
